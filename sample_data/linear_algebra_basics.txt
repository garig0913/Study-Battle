LINEAR ALGEBRA FUNDAMENTALS
===========================

Chapter 1: Vectors and Vector Operations

A vector is a mathematical object that has both magnitude and direction. In linear algebra, vectors are typically represented as ordered lists of numbers called components.

Example: v = [3, 4] is a 2-dimensional vector with components 3 and 4.

Vector Addition:
To add two vectors, add their corresponding components.
Example: [1, 2] + [3, 4] = [1+3, 2+4] = [4, 6]

Scalar Multiplication:
To multiply a vector by a scalar (number), multiply each component by that scalar.
Example: 3 * [2, 5] = [3*2, 3*5] = [6, 15]

Dot Product:
The dot product of two vectors is the sum of the products of their corresponding components.
Formula: a · b = a1*b1 + a2*b2 + ... + an*bn
Example: [1, 2, 3] · [4, 5, 6] = 1*4 + 2*5 + 3*6 = 4 + 10 + 18 = 32

Vector Magnitude (Length):
The magnitude of a vector is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.
Formula: |v| = sqrt(v1² + v2² + ... + vn²)
Example: |[3, 4]| = sqrt(3² + 4²) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5

Chapter 2: Matrices

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.

Example of a 2x3 matrix:
A = | 1  2  3 |
    | 4  5  6 |

Matrix Addition:
Add corresponding elements of matrices with the same dimensions.
Example:
| 1  2 |   | 5  6 |   | 1+5  2+6 |   | 6   8 |
| 3  4 | + | 7  8 | = | 3+7  4+8 | = | 10  12 |

Matrix Multiplication:
To multiply matrices A (m×n) and B (n×p), the resulting matrix C is m×p.
Each element C[i,j] = sum of A[i,k] * B[k,j] for all k.

Example:
| 1  2 |   | 5  6 |   | 1*5+2*7  1*6+2*8 |   | 19  22 |
| 3  4 | × | 7  8 | = | 3*5+4*7  3*6+4*8 | = | 43  50 |

Chapter 3: Matrix Operations

Transpose:
The transpose of a matrix is obtained by interchanging its rows and columns.
If A is m×n, then A^T is n×m.

Example:
A = | 1  2  3 |     A^T = | 1  4 |
    | 4  5  6 |           | 2  5 |
                          | 3  6 |

Determinant (2x2 matrix):
For a 2×2 matrix A = | a  b |, the determinant is: det(A) = ad - bc
                     | c  d |

Example:
A = | 3  2 |
    | 1  4 |
det(A) = 3*4 - 2*1 = 12 - 2 = 10

Inverse of a 2x2 Matrix:
For A = | a  b |, the inverse is: A^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * | d   -b |
        | c  d |                                        | -c   a |

Example:
A = | 4  7 |
    | 2  6 |
det(A) = 4*6 - 7*2 = 24 - 14 = 10
A^(-1) = (1/10) * | 6   -7 | = | 0.6   -0.7 |
                  | -2   4 |   | -0.2   0.4 |

Chapter 4: Systems of Linear Equations

A system of linear equations can be written in matrix form as Ax = b.

Example:
2x + 3y = 8
4x + y = 6

Matrix form: | 2  3 | | x |   | 8 |
             | 4  1 | | y | = | 6 |

Solving using inverse:
x = A^(-1) * b

For the example above:
det(A) = 2*1 - 3*4 = 2 - 12 = -10
A^(-1) = (-1/10) * | 1   -3 | = | -0.1   0.3 |
                   | -4   2 |   | 0.4   -0.2 |

x = | -0.1   0.3 | | 8 | = | -0.1*8 + 0.3*6 |   | -0.8 + 1.8 |   | 1 |
    | 0.4   -0.2 | | 6 |   | 0.4*8 - 0.2*6 | = | 3.2 - 1.2  | = | 2 |

Therefore: x = 1, y = 2

Chapter 5: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

For a square matrix A, a non-zero vector v is an eigenvector if:
Av = λv

where λ (lambda) is the corresponding eigenvalue.

To find eigenvalues:
det(A - λI) = 0

Example for a 2x2 matrix A = | 4  1 |
                             | 2  3 |

det(| 4-λ   1  |) = 0
   (| 2    3-λ |)

(4-λ)(3-λ) - 2*1 = 0
12 - 4λ - 3λ + λ² - 2 = 0
λ² - 7λ + 10 = 0
(λ - 5)(λ - 2) = 0

Eigenvalues: λ₁ = 5, λ₂ = 2
